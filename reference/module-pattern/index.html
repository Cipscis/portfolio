			<h1>Module Pattern</h1>

			<p>This page is a description of the specifics of the module pattern that I've used for the components in this repo.</p>

			<p>ECMAScript 6 added support for the native module pattern, using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import" target="_import">import</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export" target="_blank">export</a> keywords.</p>

			<p>I use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE" target="_blank">self-executing anonymous function</a> to create a separate closure where the module is defined. This has a few advantages.</p>

			<p>This approach allows me to easily create private methods by creating the module as an object containing all its public and private methods, but then returning a separate object made up only of the module's public methods. As a convention, I prefix the names of methods that should be private with an underscore.</p>

			<p>
				Constants and enumerators can also be created within this closure, though this is less useful with ECMAScript 6 modules because they already have their own
				<span class="tooltip" tabindex="0" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="tooltip-module-scope-trigger" aria-describedby="tooltip-module-scope-body">
					<span class="tooltip__trigger" id="tooltip-module-scope-trigger">module scope</span>,
					<span class="tooltip__body" id="tooltip-module-scope-body">
						<span class="p">In a standard JavaScript script, declaring a variable at the top level (i.e. not in a function) will add it to the global scope. This means it will be accessible from other scripts. If <code>var</code> is used to declare a variable in this way, it will be added as a property of the <code>window</code> object.</span>

						<span class="p">Inside a module, however, variables declared at the top level will only be created in the module scope. Similar to function scope, this means they will only be accessible within the module.</span>
					</span>
				</span>
				so you can't accidentally pollute the global scope.</p>

			<p>A second advantage is that I can use a generic name (I like to use <code>module</code>) when writing the module, and only using its unique name to declare and export it. This saves me from having to remember or check the exact name of a module whenever I need to call one of its internal methods.</p>

			<p>A third advantage is that a self-executing anonymous function allows dependencies to be declared explicitly as arguments of the function. Of course, now that ECMAScript 6 modules allow dependencies to be specified via the <code>import</code> keyword, this is less helpful, but it is still useful to be able to use this approach in contexts where support for ECMAScript 6 modules is not a reasonable assumption.</p>

			<p>In those cases, it can also allow for variables available in the global scope to be aliased. For example, if <code>jQuery</code> exists as a variable but <code>$</code> cannot be used to access it, you can pass <code>jQuery</code> in to a self-executing anonymous function as an argument called <code>$</code> and use that alias within the function.</p>

			<p>Keeping the declaration of dependencies in its own section also makes it easier to adapt a module for use in a different dependency management system, such as <a href="https://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a>.</p>

			<pre class="code code--block">const exampleModule = (function (dependencyAlias) {
	const classes = {
		active: 'is-active'
	};

	const module = {
		publicMethod: function (el) {
			// I can use the generic name "module" here,
			// instead of having to remember to use "exampleModule"
			module._privateMethod1(el);
			module._privateMethod2(el);
		},

		_privateMethod1: function (el) {
			el.classList.addClass(classes.active);
		},

		_privateMethod2: function (el) {
			dependencyAlias(el);
		}
	};

	// By creating a new object containing only the module's
	// public methods here, its private methods aren't exposed.
	return {
		publicMethod: module.publicMethod
	};
})(dependency);

export default exampleModule;</pre>

			<p>For modules that need to do more than just expose an API, I typically include an <code>init</code> method. This allows the module to be loaded immediately, but the actual initialisation step (at which point the DOM may need to have finished loading in order for events to be bound, for example) can be delayed.</p>
