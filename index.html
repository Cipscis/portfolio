			<h1>Mark's web stuff</h1>

			<p>Hello, I'm Mark. I'm a web developer. This is a little site I made as a space to put some of my web stuff that doesn't seem big enough for its own project.</p>

			<p>It's also place for me to learn and experiment with modern web technologies. If you use an old browser, like Internet Explorer 11, don't be surprised if some things don't work.</p>

			<p>You can also check out <a href="https://github.com/Cipscis?tab=repositories" target="_blank">my other repositories on Github</a> to see some of the personal coding projects I've been working on.</p>

			<h2>Philosophy</h2>

			<p>These are some notes I made when I created my <a href="https://github.com/Cipscis/blog-features" target="_blank">blog features</a> project in April 2012, which is a static site for hosting some of my more in-depth articles. It's helped keep me on track when designing components to include in that project.</p>

			<h3>Ethics</h3>

			<p>Even in something as simple as writing an article, it's important to consider ethics. Consider the following:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Do not track users' behaviour
					<ul>
						<li>If tracking behaviour is necessary, inform users first and give them an opportunity to opt out</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If potentially triggering topics will be discussed, warn users in time to give them the chance to prepare themselves or to disengage first</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Accessibility</h3>

			<p>These features, particularly the interactive ones, should be accessible. This means they should:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>work with keyboard-only navigation</li>
				<li>be usable on any device</li>
				<li>be usable without JavaScript, where possible</li>
				<li>be usable with a screen reader</li>
				<li>be usable by colourblind people</li>
				<li>be able to be printed</li>
			</ul>
