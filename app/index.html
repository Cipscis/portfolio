				<h1>Mark's web stuff</h1>

				<p>Hi, I'm Mark. I'm a nerd who tries to do the right thing. I want to use the skills I have to make the world a better place, in whatever small ways I can.</p>

				<p>This repo started as a central place for me to work on little projects that didn't really have a place of their own. Some of them were learning experiments with web technologies I hadn't use before. Some were more like practice, or proofs of concept.</p>

				<p>Since it started, I've moved many of the little projects I created here out into their own repositories. Most of them are now published on npm under my personal @cipscis scope, such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cipscis/fileio">@cipscis/fileio</a>, and I've gone on to use them in other personal projects.</p>

				<p>You can also check out <a href="https://github.com/Cipscis?tab=repositories" target="_blank">my other repositories on Github</a> to see some of the personal coding projects I've been working on.</p>

				<p>To see the technology stack I use when starting new personal projects, you can look at my <a href="https://github.com/Cipscis/base-package" target="_blank">base package</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Cipscis/base-project" target="_blank">base project</a> repos.</p>

				<h2>Node Modules</h2>

				<p>Many of these projects all started their life here, but have since been moved to their own repos and published on npm. Others were created more recently, but I've included them here for an easier reference.</p>

				<h2>Other Projects</h2>

				<p>These projects all live within my portfolio repo. Some of them were experiments with web technology that, at the time, didn't have enough browser support for me to use at work. Others are accessible UI components I've used in other personal projects that I haven't yet moved into their own repos.</p>
